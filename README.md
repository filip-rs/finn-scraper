# Finn.no Computer Deals Analyzer

## Overview

The **Finn.no Computer Deals Analyzer** is a Python-based automated system designed to scour Finn.no for computer listings, evaluate their specifications, and identify the best deals. By leveraging GPT-3.5 for data parsing and decision-making, this tool ensures that only the most relevant and cost-effective options make it to your final review. 

### Key Features:
- **Automated Finn.no Listings Scraper**: Pulls raw listings of computers from Finn.no.
- **AI-Powered Data Parsing**: Utilizes GPT-3.5 to transform raw listing data into a standardized JSON format of computer specifications.
- **Smart Filtering**: Removes irrelevant or low-quality listings based on your criteria.
- **Tournament-Style Evaluation**: Puts listings against each other in brackets, where GPT-3.5 determines the better deal in each round, ultimately selecting five finalists.
- **Final Review**: Presents the top 5 options for manual evaluation to ensure satisfaction.
